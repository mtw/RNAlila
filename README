# RNAlila 0.2

RNAlila is a C library for RNA energy landscapes, built on top of the
library of the ViennaRNA Package (https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA). It
provides library functions for investigative exploration of RNA landscape
features such as the neighborhood of secondary structures or different
types of walks, including adaptive, random and gradient walks starting from
a specific structure.

RNAlila is distributed with two executales:
  * RNAwalk performs adaptive, gradient or random walks starting from a
  secondary structure 
  * RNArandstruc computes *randomly* distributed structures over the
  Boltzmann ensemble for a RNA sequence
